This repository contains the source code for my personal landing page — a minimalist, responsive site to showcase my development work, background, and contact info.

## ✨ Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean, modern design using HTML/CSS (or your framework of choice)
- Optimized asset loading
- Profile image and intro section
- Easy-to-edit structure for future updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/landing-page.git
cd landing-page
# If you're using a build tool (e.g. npm, vite, etc.), document it here.
# Otherwise, just open index.html
